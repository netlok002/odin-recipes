            <li>1 can (13.5 ounce) full fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
            <li>2 cups yellow corn</li>
            <li>8 ounces rice noodles</li>
            <li>juice and zest from 1/2 a lime</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro and basil</li>
            
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the chicken, green onions, Worcestershire sauce, and a pinch of pepper to a bowl. Mix until just combined. Coat your hands with a bit of oil, and roll the meat into tablespoon-size balls (will make 15-20 meatballs).</li>
            <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and sear until crisp, about 4-5 minutes, turning them 2-3 times. Transfer everything to a plate.</li>
            <li>To the skillet, add the onions and bell peppers. Cook until softened, 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and curry paste. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the broth, coconut milk, tamari, honey, and peanut butter. Stir to combine. Add the corn and meatballs and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro and basil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Divide the noodles between bowls and ladle the curry over. Top each bowl as desired with basil, cilantro, lime juice, and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
